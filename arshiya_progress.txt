What I Learned:
- Git commands: init, add, commit, push
- HTML & CSS basics
- Fixing Git errors

What I Implemented:
- Created portfolio page
- Styled with CSS
- Linked GitHub & LinkedIn

Challenges Faced:
- 'src refspec main does not match any' → Fixed by creating main branch
- 'failed to push some refs' → Fixed by pulling changes before pushing
